# Automated Self-assign + Key Labeler + Contributors workflow

This repository is a collection of numerous existing actions on marketplace bunched together to function ultra-efficiently.  
All links to marketplace & usage here have been provided.
This helps keep the repo clean, concise & out of chaos moderating the process right from the beginning (issue creation) to the end (PR merge/close)

## Special Custom Action
  > ### [Issue Watcher](https://github.com/Suvraneel/Issue_Watcher)
  > #### ***Avoids misuse of self-assigns by limiting the no. of issues that can be claimed by assignees***
